<h1>Double Pendulum Simulation


 ### [YouTube Demonstration (@16:20)](https://youtu.be/RoZeVbbZ0o0?t=980)


<h2>Description</h2>
<b>This is a project completed using C programming. It is a simulation of the path of a double pendulum. The program prompts the user for the length of rod1 and rod2 as well as the "mass" of mass1 and mass2. The motion is not entirely accurate in relation to how it would physically move in real life, it does display how the velocity and motion changes based on different masses but with respect to a gravitational constant of 1 in arbitrary units. This program is made only to display the chaotic path of motion of a double pendulum in the real world.
